Hello,

To access the Role based control app run the main.py using python interpreter. You get the following output:

Enter 1 to Add user: Select this option to add a new user which is unique in database. 

Enter 2 to Delete user: To delete a user from the database you use this option.

Following points are to be Noted:

The role based access control was developed on a local server.

Add user, delete user , update user and access resource from the database were imported from pre created functions.

Following is the problem statement:

Role Based Access Control:

Implement a role-based authentication system. System should be able to assign a role to user and remove a user from the role. Entities are USER, ACTION TYPE, RESOURCE, ROLE

ACTION TYPE defines the access level (Ex: READ, WRITE, DELETE) Resource Storage: Database (PostgreSQL or Mongo) Access to resources for users are controlled strictly by the role. One user can have multiple roles. Given a user, action type and resource system should be able to tell whether user has access or not. Note: • Create class-based structure using OOPS concept. • Follow file structure to make code maintainable and production ready. • Go through git commands and push the code in git with README.md. • This is a command line application. • You do not need to create functionality to add/delete/update users or any other entities. You can get it pre-created.
